# Mood Tracker App 💭

A simple and clean React app to **track your daily mood** and optionally add notes to reflect how you're feeling. View your past entries on the **History** page and revisit your emotional journey.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- React JS
- React Router v7
- JavaScript (useState, useEffect, useRef)
- CSS3
- Moment.js
- LocalStorage

## 🔥 Features

- Select a **mood** from the dropdown menu
- Add an **optional note** to describe your mood
- Save the entry by clicking "Add"
- Navigate to **History** to view previous mood entries

## ❌ Why No Delete Button?
